## Bienvenidos

It's an application for to tell you about the weather. Type in a city, click
select, and immediately is displayed the current conditions for that city and
also a five-day forecast. Cute little icons provide a visualization. Clicking
on a recently searched city will re-display an updated screen. On mobile 
devices the display changes from a dashboard layout to a long scrolling column. 

Weather information supplied by the fine people at the openweather API.

This was a fun one. My code threw far fewer errors than I'm accustomed. I 
actually felt like I was intentionally writing something meant to work, 
rather than thrashing around in the dark.
